Check out our recent paper on <a target='blank' href='https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.103.043330'>the spin-susceptibility of the UFG above the critical temperature</a> published in Phys. Rev. A recentely where we discuss consequences for the formation of a pseudogap at unitarity. Also, keep an eye out for upcoming work on trapped fermions - slides for my recent DAMOP talk on the topic can be found <a target='blank' href='https://rammelmueller.github.io/stuff/talks/2021_06_DAMOP.pdf'>here</a>!

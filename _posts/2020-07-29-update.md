title: An update from home-office far, far away..
---
Productivity is unsteady in times of perpetual home office.. but we finally did it: Our new paper on <a target='blank' href='https://scipost.org/SciPostPhys.9.1.014'>pairing patterns in spin- and mass-imbalanced Fermi gases</a> was published in SciPost the other day. I had a great experience - fully open access and an overall great review process. Keep on Scipost!
In other news, I had my first virtual conference experience at MCQST 2020, where I presented a poster - check it out <a href=''>here</a>.

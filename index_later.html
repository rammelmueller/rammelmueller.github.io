<h1>Hey there!</h1>
<p>
  My name is Lukas Rammelm√ºller and I'm currently pursuing a PhD in the group of
  <a target='blank' href="https://theorie.ikp.physik.tu-darmstadt.de/fermions/">Prof. Jens Braun @ TU Darmstadt</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I use and develop efficient computational methods to explore the exciting world of ultracold atom physics.
  In particular, I am interested in the properties of strongly interacting quantum many-body systems at low temperatures and the possible occurence of exotic phases of matter.

  <!-- I'm a computational physicist and always happy when I can solve physics problems on a computer. -->
  <!-- My research focuses on ultracold atom systems and the development of efficient algorithms to study strongly correlated Fermi gases. -->
</p>
<p>
  If you are interested in my research or just want to say hello feel free to contact me!

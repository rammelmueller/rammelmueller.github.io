<h1>Hey there!</h1>
<p>
  I'm Lukas Rammelmüller and currently pursuing a PhD in the group of  <a target='blank' href="https://theorie.ikp.physik.tu-darmstadt.de/fermions/">Prof. Jens Braun @ TU Darmstadt</a>.

  I'm a computational physicist and always happy when I can solve physics problems on a computer. My research focuses on ultracold atom systems and the development of efficient algorithms to study strongly correlated Fermi gases.

<p>Previously I studied at TU Wien and I also had the pleasure of working at UNC Chapel Hill during several research stays.</p>

<p>If you are interested in my research or just want to say hello feel free to contact me!</p>
